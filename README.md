# TestcasesGenX

It is library to generate Graph testcases for:
1. Undirected Weighted Graph
2. Undirected Unweighted Graph
3. Directed Weighted Graph
4. Directed Unweighted Graph


Constraints:
1. MIN_NUMBER(vertices) && MIN_NUMBER(edges) > 10
2. MAX_NUMBER(vertices) <= 100000
2. Edges >= Vertices-1

How to use it?

  Open graph.cpp and run the file to get going.
